      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have had an eclectic career to this point, starting with a degree in Graphic Design I earned from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I have worked in roles ranging from production artist, to project lead, to analyst, to project coordinator. I have also worked for companies as big as Target Corporate, to small consulting companies with 20 or less employees. I am ready to take on a new direction and challenge in my career!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Green Bay, WI, but have lived most of my life in Minnesota. I also root for all the local Minnesota teams, a curse I have not been able to overcome (with the exception of a handful of Twins and Lynx championships!).</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy cooking, graphic arts, exercise, road trips with my wife and kids (we will be driving out to Myrtle Beach for a week just before the start of Bootcamp!).</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is more about its essence than its destination. I would like to have something I can point to at the end of the day and say, "here is what I contributed to this project". Like architecture, I see web development work as something I can work on building every day and see the progress toward the final vision to be achieved. What it really boils down to is, I want to take the various skills I have, develop them, and use them to build something.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Rosemount, MN, and am in the process of moving into a new construction home, also in Rosemount. Why take on one major life challenge at a time when you can take on two!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Art and science and math have long been in my wheelhouse, and I pursued my degree in graphic design as I saw the program to be a great blend of all them. And at the time, I really loved print media. Now I feel ready to branch out and explore similar opportunities and challenges that web development can offer.</p>
